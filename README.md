# 🧮 Node.js Calculator

This is my first Node.js project — a simple Calculator application that performs basic operations like addition of two numbers.  
I built this project while learning the fundamentals of **Node.js**, such as creating a server, handling requests, and working with core modules.

This project is the starting point of my backend journey, and I’ll be extending it further while learning **Express.js** to build a complete web-based calculator.
